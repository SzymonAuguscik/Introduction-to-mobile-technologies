### TapMe
It's just my very first app, some kind of "Hello world" to programming in Kotlin.

### Calculator
It's my version of mobile calculator that allows user to add, subtract, multiply and divide integer and float numbers. 

### CurrencyRates
It's the most complex app in this repo. Its main task is to show details about currencies based on data from [NBP api](http://api.nbp.pl/). App offers 3 main functionalities:
- display list of current currencies rates and two charts after choosing one
- calculate equivalent value of PLN/foreign currency with respect to foreign currency/PLN
- display details (current rate, value chart) about gold
